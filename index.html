<!--About Summit-->
		<header>
		<a id="about"><h1> Summit Connect </h1></a>
			<p>| <strong>LEARN</strong> | It's important to get into a connect group because it helps you to  spiritually grow through understanding God's word together. You can face life challenges with people who have or are facing those same challenges as you.
			| <strong>SERVE</strong> | By serving others, it not only impacts you &amp; your group but the people your serving. It helps others see that there are people who still care for others &amp; are not selfish as most people.
			| <strong>WORSHIP</strong> | Worshiping is a <em><span>BIG</span></em> concept &amp; being in a connect group is an act of worship.</p>

		<h3><a id="gallery"> Gallery </a></h3>
		<p> Here are some images of our connect groups during NiceServ, Recreational/Connect Group, and Beach Baptism. Be sure to participate in our next NiceServ event. NiceServ takes place every 4 months. 
		    For each event you can sign up for 4 hours on Saturdays. To then you will meet with your group on Saturday and drive to the site. Another event we have to fellowship with other people is through Connect Groups. 
		    Every 8 weeks we will have an area designated for individuals to sign up with a Connect Group. Either make your own or sign up with one that has already started. Either way, its a great way to meet people.
		    Other important event we have is our Beach Baptism. This takes place 2 times out of the year. Check out our website to get dates on our next Beach Baptism.  </p>
